# Pictok
A photo sharing app for visually impaired young adults (VIPs). VIPs will be able to take pictures, and AI will recognise objects in the picture, and will output an audio soundscape based on the objects in the image. 

## Motivation
Based on our research, we found out that teens with visual impairments want to engage with photos visually, similar to their sighted peers, but encounter limitations in photo sharing in current social media apps. 

Our team at PicTok found a way to incorporate the AI models, [`audiogen`](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/audiogen.html) from Meta and [`gpt-4-Vision`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) from openAI to transform images into a rich auditory experience to enhance the photo sharing journey for the visually impaired.
